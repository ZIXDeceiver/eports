            <h2>Relfection</h2>
To be frank, this second quarter I haven't learned much, not only in this subject but in all other. Maybe its due to me taking on extracurricular activities, like Dancesports and Seminars. But for the parts that I did get to learn, those I understand enough to a fault.         
Overall, this entire quarter was: A. too short and B. far too crowded with events, seminars and such. But it also had its upsides. Thank you for visit my Second E-Portfolio, may we meet in the Third. But until then have fun, Byyeeee.
