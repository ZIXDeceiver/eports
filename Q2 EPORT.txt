            <p>Hello Dear User, welcome back. If you're clicking this then you already know who I am. But if you don't that's alright. For starters, I am Iorick Xarles Dulay, Class Secretary of Grade 9 Faith. I am now currently 15 years old and attending Las Piñas City National Science High School. Since this would be the last Electronic Portfolio I would submit for this year. I decided to compile all of them here for you for Simplicity's sake. Now here's some more information about what happened to me over this entire school year. Enjoy! </p>

            <h2>Relfection</h2>
To be frank, this second quarter I haven't learned much, not only in this subject but in all other. Maybe its due to me taking on extracurricular activities, like Dancesports and Seminars. But for the parts that I did get to learn, those I understand enough to a fault.         
Overall, this entire quarter was: A. too short and B. far too crowded with events, seminars and such. But it also had its upsides. Thank you for visit my Second E-Portfolio, may we meet in the Third. But until then have fun, Byyeeee.
